# go-learn

My journey into the Go programming language. 

## Project List

1. [helloWorld](./helloWorld) - Hello World in Go!
2. [myModule](./myModule) - Created a custom module in Go with an introduction to functions, error handling, arrays, maps, unit testing, and compiling. 
3. [workspace](./workspace) - A multi-module workspace introduction.
4. [web-service-gin](./web-service-gin) - A RESTful API with the Gin web framework.
5. [generics](./generics) - Introduction to generics, type inferencing, and type interfaces. 
6. [fuzzing](./fuzzing) - A demonstration of fuzzing on string inputs. UTF-8 strings are composed of runes that may be multi-byte in size.
7. [gowiki](./wiki) Web app for users to create, edit, and view custom wiki pages! Added support for dynamically adding interpage links from the user. Also an introduction to templates, template caching, input validation, function literals, and closures in Go.

## A Tour of Go
[go-tour](./go-tour/) has my notes and exercises from the "A Tour of Go" tutorial.

## Effective Go
[Go conventions](./notes/go-conventions.md) contain best coding practices for programming in Go. 

## Cheatsheets
Some cheatsheets I find useful when learning Go. 

Currently only has format specifiers for fmt.
